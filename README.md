## Etymology <a id="etymology"></a>

This project's "barn name" is Liana (_lee-ah-na_), after the woody vines that grow up around trees [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liana).  It belongs to a collection of repositories that have tree-themed names (they're not all public).  That liana's aren't themselves trees, but instead follow the form of the tree they grow up around, is a nod to how invisible XML is used to reveal the form of an XML tree.

However, "iXSpec Test Runner" better describes what this tool does.
