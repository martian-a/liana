# iXSpec Test Runner

Status: In development (2024-10-04)

## Summary

An (unofficial) extension to XSpec, for writing and running tests for Invisible XML (iXML).

## Name

This project's "barn name" is Liana (_lee-ah-na_), after the woody vines that grow up around trees (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liana).  It belongs to Xylarium, a "stable" of repositories relating to XML, each of which has a tree-themed name (they're not all public).  That liana's aren't themselves trees, but instead follow the form of the tree they grow up around, is a nod to how invisible XML is used to reveal the form of an XML tree.

However, "iXSpec Test Runner" better describes what this tool does.
